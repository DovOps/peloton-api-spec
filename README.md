Unofficial Peloton OpenAPI Spec

This is an unofficial Peloton REST API spec that I've been modelling to help with various google sheets and other hobby projects to get at my data. Contributions are welcome!

Edits are generally made at https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/DovOps/peloton-unofficial-api/  at the moment, but this will likely have to change when people contribute directly to the project because the Free SwaggerHub tools do not pull from GitHub, they only push to GitHub.
